<h1>Hello, coders!</h1>
<h2>This is an experimental autoclicker.</h2>
<p>It was mode solely for fun and to explore Python's keyboard and mouse libraries. You can use it for free, modify it yourself or just farm some cookies on cookie clicker... hahaha</p>

<h2>CAUTION!</h2>
<p>This is still in production. <br></br>The current version (v2.1) is way more optimized and may run fine all times. But, I recommend you test it in a higher "PAUSE" time (like 1 or 2) before running it on the "normal" config (0.0001). Also, I recommend not changing the timesleep() value.</p>

<h2>Happy clicking!</h2>
