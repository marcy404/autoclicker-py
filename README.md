<h1>Hello, coders!</h1>
<h3>This is an experimental autoclicker</h3>
<p>It was mode solely for fun. I play Cookie Clicker so this helps a lot sometimes</p>
<hr>
<h2>CAUTION!</h2>
<p>Because of the two libraries used, it crashes a bit. And please, be careful, this can actually crash a PC. Theres a "time.sleep" in the middle of the code. If you want more time before the dangerous clicking starts, just change that value.</p>
<p>Also, note that, to stop the clicking, the command "ctrl + shift + alt + s" is used. You can change it, but I really wouldn't recommend it. If you set a shortcut that is already in use, a pretty big issue can happen</p>

<h2>Happy clicking!</h2>
